## 🌟 Project Vision & 0G Fit

### 1. Vision Statement
High-performance Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently monopolized by heavily funded centralized clouds. This consolidation threatens **data sovereignty**, imposes **high markup pricing**, and lacks **verifiable execution**. 

**TeeTee** democratizes AI access by creating a decentralized cluster where massive models are split by layers (layer sharding) and hosted across hardware-isolated Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Anyone can host a shard, secure ownership of model metadata via ERC-7857 iNFTs, and earn passive income, while users get verifiable, private, and sub-second AI inferences at a **10x cost reduction**.

### 2. Why 0G is the Perfect Fit
TeeTee requires a high-performance, low-latency, and highly secure infrastructure that only the **0G Network** can provide:

*   **⚡ High-Speed Model Provisioning (0G Storage)**: Neural network weights are massive (70B+ parameters require 140GB+ memory). 0G Storage's **2GB/s throughput** ensures TEE nodes can load, verify, and switch model shards instantly at near-zero storage costs (~$10/TB vs $1000+/TB on traditional networks).
*   **💸 Low-Cost, High-Frequency Settlements (0G Chain)**: TeeTee implements a micro-billing pay-per-token model. 0G Chain's **2,500+ TPS and sub-second finality** enable real-time, low-fee settlements of credit consumption directly from smart contracts.
*   **🛡️ Secure Metadata Ownership (0G iNFT & ECIES)**: Leveraging the ERC-7857 Intelligent NFT standard, model weights and user chat histories are encrypted asymmetrically via ECIES and stored on 0G Storage, with decryption keys securely processed only inside Phala TEE enclaves.

### 3. Core Architecture Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Centralized Cloud (e.g. OpenAI) | Traditional DePIN (Local GPU) | TeeTee (0G + TEE Sharding) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Privacy & Sovereignty** | ❌ None (Inputs sent to central servers) | ⚠️ Opaque (Hosts can inspect raw prompts/weights) | ✅ **Absolute** (Encrypted weights decrypted ONLY inside TEE) |
| **Model Weight Security** | ⚠️ Custodial (Must trust centralized provider) | ❌ Exposed (Weights are distributed in plaintext) | ✅ **Sealed** (ECIES-encrypted metadata keys on-chain) |
| **Hardware Costs** | ❌ Premium (Must fund entire A100/H100 clusters) | ✅ Lower (Uses idle commodity consumer GPUs) | 🚀 **Fractional** (Layer sharding splits hardware cost among hosts) |
| **Inference Latency** | ✅ Milliseconds | ❌ High (Passing full states over slow connections) | ⚡ **Sub-second** (Pipelined tensor activation passing) |
| **Auditability** | ❌ Black-Box (Must trust returned output) | ⚠️ Complex (Computation verifications are slow/expensive) | ✅ **Instant** (TEE hardware attestation + Merkle storage proofs) |

📄 **Research & White Paper**: [TeeTee Technical Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_g_0f35Rdzx2W_6PkjKKRscLBLe_7QvbgQBehHOtR4/edit?tab=t.0) - Our self-researched approach to distributed LLM inference in TEE

---

## 🎯 Unique Selling Point (USP)

### What Makes TeeTee Stand Out in the 0G Ecosystem?

**TeeTee is the world's first implementation of layer-sharded LLM inference across distributed Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), backed by original research and deployed on 0G's high-performance infrastructure.**

#### 1. **First Implementation of LLM Sharding in TEE (Research-Backed)**

**The Problem:** Today's AI landscape forces a painful choice between **privacy vs. price**:
- 🚨 Ship sensitive data to third-party LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic) → **Zero privacy**
- 💸 Self-host models on your own hardware → **$100K+ upfront** (GPUs, maintenance, ops)
- 🤏 Most teams settle for smaller, weaker models due to cost constraints

**Our Solution:** TeeTee introduces a **novel layer-sharding approach** where we split large language models by layers and distribute them across multiple verifiable TEEs:

```
Example: GPT-style 48-layer model
├─ TEE Shard 1: Layers 1-12
├─ TEE Shard 2: Layers 13-24
├─ TEE Shard 3: Layers 25-36
└─ TEE Shard 4: Layers 37-48
```

**How It Works:**
- 🔗 **Request Flows Through TEE Chain**: Your query enters TEE1 → TEE2 → ... → TEEn
- 🔐 **Zero Raw Data Exposure**: Only intermediate activations/tensors pass between shards (never raw text or weights)
- ✅ **Hardware Attestation per Hop**: Each TEE emits cryptographic proof of secure execution
- 🎯 **Single Entry Endpoint**: Orchestrator coordinates the chain; final output returns to you
- 💰 **On-Chain Settlement**: Credits/payments settle automatically on 0G mainnet
- 📦 **0G Storage Integration**: Model weights stored on 0G Storage's decentralized network (2GB/s throughput, ~$10/TB)
- 💬 **Chat History on 0G**: Conversation logs and user context stored on 0G Storage for retrieval and continuity

**Why This Matters:**
- 🛡️ **Private Data Stays Private**: Verifiable TEE execution with no plaintext exposure
- 📈 **Models Scale Beyond Single-TEE Limits**: Run 70B+ parameter models that won't fit in one TEE
- 💵 **10x Cost Reduction**: Companies host just one shard (~$10K) yet access the full, high-quality model
- 🌐 **Resilient & Decentralized**: No vendor lock-in, auto-failover, no single point of failure
- 💾 **Cost-Effective Storage**: 0G Storage provides 10-100x cheaper storage vs. centralized alternatives
- 🔬 **Research-Validated**: [Read our technical white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_g_0f35Rdzx2W_6PkjKKRscLBLe_7QvbgQBehHOtR4/edit?tab=t.0) documenting our approach

**Production Ready:** Unlike theoretical proposals, TeeTee is **live at [teetee.site](https://teetee.site)** with real models (DeepSeek V3, Llama 3.3) serving production traffic today.

**🌐 Impact on 0G Ecosystem:**

TeeTee's research-backed LLM sharding solves the "$100K GPU barrier" that blocks most companies from adopting private AI. By enabling **enterprise-grade AI privacy at consumer prices**, we're creating the **first killer use case** that drives real companies to 0G Network:

- 📊 **Enterprise Demand**: Healthcare, legal, and financial companies need private AI but can't afford $100K+ GPU infrastructure. TeeTee makes them **0G users overnight**
- 💰 **Storage Revenue**: Every TeeTee deployment stores gigabytes of model weights + chat history on **0G Storage**, creating sustained demand and revenue for 0G storage providers
- ⛓️ **On-Chain Activity**: Every inference request = on-chain credit transaction on **0G Chain**, directly increasing network activity and TVL
- 👥 **Developer Onboarding**: Our research proves decentralized AI works at production scale. Companies building with TeeTee **become 0G developers** (using 0G Storage SDK, 0G Chain contracts)
- 🔄 **Network Effects**: As more shards join TeeTee, the network becomes more resilient and cost-effective, attracting more hosters → more storage → more on-chain settlement → **0G ecosystem growth**

**Bottom Line:** TeeTee isn't just using 0G—we're the **gateway that brings enterprises to 0G** by solving a real pain point (privacy + cost) that Web2 AI platforms can't address.

    KeyA -->|Sealed Key A| Dec
    Dec --> ReEnc
    ReEnc -->|Sealed Key B| KeyB
    EncData --> Dec
    ReEnc --> EncDataB
```

- 🎨 **AI Agent Ownership**: Tokenize and trade AI models as NFTs with embedded intelligence
- 🔐 **Secure Metadata Transfer**: When an iNFT is sold, the AI model, memory, and traits transfer securely via oracle-assisted encryption
- 💼 **New Economic Models**: Create AI agent marketplaces, rental systems, and royalty structures impossible with traditional NFTs
- 📦 **0G Storage for AI Metadata**: Neural network weights, agent memory, and character traits stored on **0G Storage** with encryption
- 🔄 **Decentralized Metadata Updates**: Dynamic AI agent evolution tracked and stored on 0G's decentralized infrastructure

This positions TeeTee as the **infrastructure layer for the future AI agent economy** on 0G.

**🌐 Impact on 0G Ecosystem:**

iNFTs unlock the **$100B+ AI agent market** for 0G by making AI models tradable, ownable assets—a use case impossible on traditional chains without 0G's high-performance storage:

- 🛒 **AI Marketplaces on 0G**: Companies building AI agent marketplaces (like OpenSea for AI models) **must use 0G Storage** to handle gigabyte-sized neural network files at affordable costs (~$10/TB vs. $1000+/TB on centralized storage)
- 🏢 **Enterprise Licensing**: B2B AI companies can now sell/license their models as iNFTs. Each sale = metadata stored on **0G Storage** + ownership transfer on **0G Chain** = sustained network usage
- 💎 **NFT Ecosystem Expansion**: Traditional NFT projects (PFPs, gaming) can now embed AI agents into their tokens. A gaming NFT with embedded AI personality = model weights on **0G Storage** = new use case driving 0G adoption
- 🤖 **Autonomous AI Agents**: Future DAOs and autonomous agents need on-chain identity. TeeTee's iNFT standard becomes the **de facto choice** for AI agent identity on 0G, creating a moat
- 📈 **Storage & Compute Growth**: Every iNFT mint/transfer = metadata operations on 0G Storage + oracle verification on 0G Chain = **direct revenue for 0G validators and storage providers**

**Bottom Line:** iNFTs make 0G the **home for the AI agent economy**. Companies building AI marketplaces, licensing platforms, or autonomous agents will choose 0G because TeeTee proves the infrastructure works at scale.

#### 3. **Fair, Transparent Credit Economy**

Unlike opaque subscription models or centralized billing, TeeTee implements a pay-per-token settlement lifecycle:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User as User Wallet
    participant SC as CreditUse Contract
    participant Oracle as Oracle Backend
    participant TEE as TEE Cluster
    participant Host as Shard Hosters

    User->>SC: Buy Credits (Deposit 0G)
    SC-->>User: Mint Credits
    User->>Oracle: Submit Prompts (using Credits)
    Oracle->>TEE: Route to TEE Cluster
    TEE-->>Oracle: Secure Inference Response
    Oracle->>SC: Report Prompt Usage (Tokens count)
    SC->>SC: Deduct User Credits
    SC->>Host: Distribute Rewards to Hosters
    Host->>SC: Claim Withdrawable Earnings
    SC-->>Host: Transfer 0G Tokens
```

- 💰 **Pay-Per-Token**: Only pay for what you use, down to the token level
- 📊 **On-Chain Verification**: Every credit transaction is verifiable on **0G Chain mainnet** with full transparency
- 🎁 **Hoster Incentives**: Model hosters earn directly from usage with automated settlements on **0G Chain**
- 🔓 **No Lock-In**: Credits are portable and can be withdrawn anytime via **0G Chain** smart contracts
- 👥 **Auto-Profit Sharing**: When users query your hosted shard, you earn instantly—settled on-chain
- 💳 **Usage Logs on 0G Storage**: Every query, token count, and payment is logged to **0G Storage** for auditing and dispute resolution

Our credit system aligns incentives between users, hosters, and the platform—**creating a sustainable, decentralized AI economy** where anyone can participate.

**🌐 Impact on 0G Ecosystem:**

TeeTee's transparent credit economy creates **high-frequency on-chain activity** and drives enterprise adoption by solving AI's biggest pain point: unpredictable costs and vendor lock-in:

- ⛓️ **Thousands of Daily Transactions**: Every AI inference = on-chain credit deduction on **0G Chain**. With 1M+ queries/day (our 2025 target), that's **1M+ on-chain transactions daily** = sustained network activity and gas revenue
- 🏦 **Enterprise Budget Clarity**: CFOs hate unpredictable AI bills. TeeTee's pay-per-token model with on-chain auditing solves this. Companies that adopt TeeTee for cost transparency **become 0G Chain users by default**
- 💰 **Hoster Economy**: Anyone can host a shard and earn. A university hosting one shard earns passive income when researchers use it → **0G becomes the platform where academic institutions monetize their compute**
- 📈 **TVL Growth**: Credits are purchased and staked on **0G Chain**. As TeeTee scales to 50K users (2025 target), millions in credits lock into 0G smart contracts = **direct TVL growth**
- 🔄 **Usage Data = 0G Storage Revenue**: Every query's token count, cost, and metadata logged to **0G Storage** for compliance and auditing. Enterprise customers need these logs for SOC2/ISO compliance → **sustained storage revenue**
- 🌍 **Global Micropayments**: TeeTee enables researchers in developing countries to access AI for pennies. This **global accessibility** showcases 0G's low fees and fast settlement—a killer demo for enterprise onboarding

**Bottom Line:** TeeTee's credit economy transforms 0G from "another L1" into **the global settlement layer for AI payments**. Every company adopting TeeTee = company using 0G Chain daily for real business operations.

## 🛠 Technical Approach & Deep-Dive

### 1. Mathematical Model of Layer Sharding
Traditional distributed inference requires model replication across multiple nodes, which is capital-intensive. TeeTee uses a layer-sharding approach.

Given an LLM network $\mathcal{M}$ represented as a composition of $L$ layers:
$$\mathcal{M}(x) = f_L(f_{L-1}(\dots f_1(x)\dots))$$

We partition the network layers into $N$ distinct contiguous shards $\mathcal{S}_i$:
$$\mathcal{S}_i = f_{r_i} \circ f_{r_i-1} \circ \dots \circ f_{l_i} \quad \text{where } l_i = 1 + \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} |\mathcal{S}_j| \text{ and } r_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i} |\mathcal{S}_j|$$

During inference:
1. The client sends input $x = a_0$ to Shard 1.
2. Each shard $\mathcal{S}_i$ processes the incoming tensor $a_{i-1}$ to compute the activation output $a_i$:
   $$a_i = \mathcal{S}_i(a_{i-1})$$
3. The activation tensor $a_i$ is passed sequentially to Shard $i+1$.
4. The final shard outputs the token probabilities:
   $$y = a_N = \mathcal{S}_N(a_{N-1})$$

Since the intermediate states $a_i$ are abstract activation matrices (embeddings) rather than human-readable text, **zero private data or model weights are ever exposed in transit**.

### 2. Cryptographic Security & Verification Stack

TeeTee ensures absolute confidentiality and auditability of decentralized AI via a multi-layered cryptographic trust stack:

```mermaid

    classDef secure fill:#0f172a,stroke:#38bdf8,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff;
    classDef storage fill:#064e3b,stroke:#059669,stroke-width:1px,color:#d1fae5;
    classDef enclave fill:#581c87,stroke:#c084fc,stroke-width:1px,color:#f3e8ff;

    ModelWeights[Model Weights & Shard Parameters] -->|1. Encrypted via AES-256-CTR| EncBlob[Encrypted Shard Blob]:::storage
    EncBlob -->|2. Uploaded to| ZeroGStorage[0G Decentralized Storage]:::storage
    
    OwnerPrivateKey[iNFT Owner Private Key] -->|3. Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption ECIES| MetadataKey[Sealed Key on 0G Chain]:::secure
    
    PhalaTEE[Phala TEE Hardware Enclave]:::enclave -->|4. Verifies Merkle Root Proof| Verification[0G Storage Proof-of-Data]:::secure
    PhalaTEE -->|5. Cryptographic Attestation| MRENCLAVE[On-Chain Verified MRENCLAVE Code Signature]:::secure
```

*   **Confidentiality at Rest (0G Storage + ECIES)**: Shard parameter weights are encrypted symmetrically using AES-256-CTR. The key is sealed asymmetrically using **ECIES** (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme) for the recipient's public key (corresponding to the TEE enclave) and stored inside the metadata of the ERC-7857 iNFT.
*   **Tamper-Proof Execution (Merkle Inclusion Proofs)**: TEE nodes fetch model fragments from 0G Storage. The storage client automatically computes and verifies the Merkle roots on-chain, proving the downloaded files match the original registered hashes.
*   **Verifiable Execution (TEE Hardware Attestation)**: The computing brokers run exclusively inside Phala Network enclaves. When processing a shard request, the TEE creates a **Remote Attestation Proof** (SgxQuote) verifying that the exact model weights were loaded inside hardware-isolated memory and that the computed outputs (activations) were indeed generated by that model.

### Architecture Diagrams & Flow

TeeTee's architecture consists of three interconnected flows:

- **🟣 Purple: Platform (TeeTee) Flow** - Core infrastructure and shard management
- **🔴 Red: Host Flow** - Model hosting and TEE deployment
- **🔵 Teal: User Flow** - End-user inference and payments

---

#### Complete Architecture Overview

**The complete system architecture showing all components and their interactions:**
- **INFT Management**: Minting, authorization, and ownership on 0G Chain
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Credit management and on-chain settlements
- **Oracle System**: Health monitoring, TEE status verification, and inference routing
- **0G Storage**: Decentralized storage for model weights, chat history, and metadata
- **TEE Hosts**: Trusted Execution Environment nodes running model shards
- **User Interface**: Frontend for queries, Console for management, and Dashboard for analytics

---

#### 🟣 Platform Flow: Shard Publishing & Registry

**1. Publish Shard Artifacts (Platform Operation)**
```
Package Shards → Upload to 0G Storage → Record Hash on 0G Chain → Link to iNFT
```

- **Package Each Shard**: Split model by layers (e.g., Layers 1-11, Layers 12-22)
- **Upload to 0G Storage**: Store sharded model weights on decentralized storage
- **Record Content Hash**: Register storage URI in registry contract on 0G Chain
- **Link to iNFT Metadata**: iNFT metadata points to uploaded LLM shard location on 0G Storage

This ensures deterministic, verifiable model deployment across the network.

---

#### 🔴 Host Flow: Onboarding & Deployment

**1. Host Onboarding with iNFT Minting**
- Host mints or receives an iNFT pointing to shard's encrypted metadata
- iNFT contains storage location on 0G Storage
- Ownership tracked on 0G Chain via ERC-7857

**2. Secure Retrieval & TEE Provisioning**
- Host's TEE-backed node fetches shard from 0G Storage
- Node loads model weights into secure TEE environment
- Exposes `/generate` and `/process` endpoints
- Registers endpoint URL and shard hash on 0G Chain

**3. Activation & Verification**
- Oracle validates deployed shard hash matches iNFT metadata
- Confirms node is reachable and serving (health check)
- On success: Oracle activates iNFT and enables revenue sharing
- On failure: Access blocked until hash/endpoint issues resolved

**4. Monitoring & Lifecycle**
- Oracle performs periodic health checks (endpoint liveness)
- If node goes offline or hash mismatches → access suspended
- Traffic automatically rerouted to healthy providers
- iNFTs can be deactivated/rotated on operator changes or upgrades

**Host Benefits:**
- **Direct Access**: Hosts whitelisted for cost-free access to their own nodes
- **Auto-Profit Sharing**: Earn when others use your shard
- **Register for LLM Nodes**: Join existing models to earn passive income

---

#### 🔵 User Flow: Payments & Inference

**1. Payments & Access**
- Users pay credits into smart contract on 0G Chain (0.001 0G = 200 credits)
- Contract meters requests based on token usage
- Settles payments with providers via 0G Compute Network (permissionless)
- All transactions verifiable on-chain

**2. Query Relay & Inference**

**Layer-Sharded Inference Flow:**
```
User Query → TEE 1 (Layers 1-11) → TEE 2 (Layers 12-22) → ... → TEE N → Response
```

- **Lightweight Relayer**: Oracle service watches on-chain events and routes requests
- **Distributed Processing**: Query flows through multiple TEE shards
  - Each shard processes its assigned layers
  - Only intermediate activations/tensors pass between TEEs (never raw text or weights)
  - Each hop emits hardware attestation for verification
- **Single Entry Endpoint**: Orchestrator coordinates the entire chain
- **Final Output**: Assembled response returns to user
- **On-Chain Settlement**: Credits/payments settle automatically on 0G mainnet
- **Proof Anchoring**: Attestation references stored on-chain for auditability

**Key Security Features:**
- 🔒 **Zero Raw Data Exposure**: Only tensors pass between shards
- ✅ **Hardware Attestation**: Each TEE proves secure execution
- 🛡️ **Verifiable Compute**: Cryptographic proof at every hop

**3. Logs & Transcripts**
- User chat history persisted to 0G Storage for privacy
- Request metadata stored for auditing
- Retrieval for conversation continuity
- All data encrypted and owned by user

---

#### Cost Advantages

**Traditional Approach:**
- Single entity hosts entire model: $100K+ upfront (GPUs + infrastructure)
- High maintenance costs, single point of failure

**TeeTee's Sharded Approach:**
- Companies host just **one shard** (~$10K investment)
- Access full, high-quality model via the network
- 10x cost reduction while maintaining privacy
- Earn revenue when others use your shard
- Resilient and decentralized (no vendor lock-in)
